Table Functions return the table.

1. Filter is a table function which filters the contents of the table based on a condition. 
Sales Amount Multiple Items = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(
        Sales,
        Sales[Order Quantity]>1
    ),
    Sales[Order Quantity]*Sales[Unit Price]
)
In place of the physical table 'Sales', Filter function is used as a table reference. 

2. Variables can store tables too. Modifying the above code to leverage the Variable functionality.
Sales Amount Multiple Items(Variable) = 
Var MultipleItems=                         --Stores a whole table whose Order Quantity>1 from the sales table, as it's expression is a table function.
 FILTER(
        Sales,
        Sales[Order Quantity]>1
    )
RETURN
SUMX(
    MultipleItems,
    Sales[Order Quantity]*Sales[Unit Price]
)

3. In a calculated column or an iterator function, RELATEDTABLE function could be used to retrieve the rows of the related table, as a table.

Product Sales Amount = 
SUMX(
    RELATEDTABLE(Sales),
    Sales[Order Quantity]*Sales[Unit Price]
)

Table Functions can be nested too. 
For eg., the below calculated column calculates the Sales Amount for the table returned by Filter function(FILTER) which has filtered the rows of the related table(RELATEDTABLE) 
based on the condition of Order Quantity placed greater than 1.

Product Sales Amount MultipleItems = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(
    RELATEDTABLE(Sales),
    Sales[Order Quantity]>1
    ),
    Sales[Order Quantity]*Sales[Unit Price]
)
